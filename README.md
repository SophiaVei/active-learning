# Active Learning
This work aims to consolidate the objects of the active and the
interpretable machine learning. In the assignment we will work with the dataset
diabetes.  

Part A  
In the first part we will work on the subject of active learning.
We divide the test set into 2 subsets, an unlabeled pool set and a 50% test set.
We experiment with an active learning algorithm (e.g. uncertainty sampling) and the
absence of active learning (random sampling). We present and comment on the results.
We make use of the modAL library.  

Part B  
In the second part we will work on the subject of interpretable machine learning. We train a white box and a black box, where the black box achieves
higher prediction accuracy than the white box. We give a global interpretation of the above models. We give a local interpretation of a decision of theirs for an example of the test set. We comment on our results.
